# Development of Predictive Model for the Classification of genes associated with abiotic stress-resistant traits in rice using Deep Learning

This research is my final year project for my Bachelor's degree in Bioinformatics. In this research study, I developed deep learning predictive models to classify genes associated with stress-resistant traits, streamlining the analysis of vast-scale genomic data. 

## Research Aim and Objective

This study aims to establish the predictive models for the classification of genes associated with abiotic stress-resistant traits in rice. Specifically, the objectives of this study are: 

1. To construct deep learning-based predictive model of casual genes related to stress-resistant traits 
2. To measure the performance accuracy of the predictive models 
3. To examine the genes associated with the abiotic stress-resistant traits in rice
